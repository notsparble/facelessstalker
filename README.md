# The Faceless Stalker [v69]

![Slender Image 1](https://i.imgur.com/jLTNNjM.png)

Adds the famous Slenderman as well as collectable pages to Lethal Company!

Mysterious pages have appeared inside the facility... They depict what seems like a tall humanoid entity - Weirdly enough, the creature appears to be lacking any facial features.
According to the employer, these pages are highly valuable, but any employees collecting them are advised to 'regularily check behind their backs'.

Why? No one knows, but there seems to be more to them than meets the eye.

Anyways, what could possibly go wrong?


# Config

Note that the Faceless Stalker has many config options regarding his behaviour as well as the spawn rarity of pages and various other elements.

# Enemy AI (Spoilers!)

!!! It is highly recommended to NOT check this section and rather explore this mod by yourselves, as the pages already hint at the behaviour of the Faceless Stalker !!!


The enemy AI has four behaviour stages, and, in short, works like this:
As soon as any player picks up a page, the Faceless Stalker (Slenderman) will spawn on the map.
First of all, it will choose a player to haunt, after which it will regularily search for spots on the map with eye contact to the haunted player, but outside of their FOV.
As soon as it has found a spot, a deep bass sound may or may not be heard, indicating the presence of the Stalker. 
During its stalking phase, only the haunted player will be able to see the Stalker; while everybody will be able to see it during a chase.
If not looked at, it will creep closer towards the haunted player in intervals - when looking at the Stalker, depending on the distance to the player, it will either vanish, or start chasing the player.
The closer the Stalker is to the player, the higher the chances of initiating a chase are, so regularily check your back to keep him distant.
During a chase, any non-haunted player fast enough can try to intercept the Stalker, which will result in the entity disappearing and haunting the intercepting player instead.
